1. Should order_address, order_banking have a relation with address or client_address? Because publisher, warehouse and client all access the same address entity. 
2. How would Owner connect?
3. Want to have a relationship with warehouse for order. Thought of connecting order to warehouse, but then no access to book info and redudent as books point to warehouse. Then I thought of connecting order_book to warehouse. 
   But this also won't work too well. Because the requirements mention a single warehouse for all books (not each). 

3/26:
1. Duel total participation allowed???
2. Hierachy weak entity set
3. Request book correct or not?
4. Relations without data sharing?

3/27:
1. Relations without data sharing
2. Aggreation
3. Does my ER have to be normalized? For example my order_book and warehouse one.  
4. Do I even need to have warehouse_id in order_book?
5. For normalizing my order_book and warehouse_book, can I just create a unique ID for warehouse_book and reference that?
6. For order_book, order_number and isbn are primary keys. isbn and warehouse_id are taken from the warehouse_books, but warehouse_id isn't a primary key, or should it?
7. Making functional dependencies for everything?
