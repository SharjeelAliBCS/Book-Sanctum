# Book Sanctum, an artificial bookstore web application

## Overview

This bookstore application was created as the main project for a Carleton University course, COMP 3005: Database Management Systems in April 2020. Note, however that this application is artificial, in that the user does not have the capability of actually ordering books online. As such, please be advised that inputting personal information is strictly discouraged. 

## Implementation

The project implements node.js and express for the server side and basic CSS for stylization. One future goal of the project is to develop a more robust front-end system, such as implementing React, etc. and creating a more friendly mobile experience.
